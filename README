- Install awesome on system.
- Alacrity/kitty doesn't work through NIX. Install through normal means.
-- Or use `nixGL alacritty`, can't figure out on how to call it through awesome though.
- Install libstdc++{version}-dev on host machine, where version must be the same as the used clang compiler.
-- Or latest version supported by the repo and pray.
- Install xclip (or other clipboard manager) from system. Some can't find libbsd if installed through nix.
