Note:
- Alacrity doesn't work through NIX. Install through normal means.
- Install copy-past utilities on host system (xclip for x11).
- Install obsidian on host machine

whish-list:
- Auto setup nerdfont
-- https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/Hack.zip
- Think about fedora
-- nerdfont
-- set default shell
--- instal util-linux
--- `chsh -s {path-to-zsh}` (should work for every distro)

- Use regolith like desctop environment?

- nvim:
-- telescope pop-up bigger
-- additional jump to highlight (one for jump to any and one for jump to same)
-- LSP suggestions are too high on the autocomplete list

- Notetaking:
-- image.nvim needs kitty terminal
-- zk and zk-nvim
-- neorg
-- obsidian with git plugin
